# ObsidiaNotes -

## - because Notetaking is hard.

> Apple Notes is annoying on Windows, clouds need a bunch of setup for each new device, and Notion files won't be easily readable anymore if Notion ever closes it's doors.

This notetaking setup uses GitHub as infinite free cloud storage, Obsidian as a nice UI and wrapper for what's essentially just the forever functional (and awesome) Markdown format, and doesn't even need to install a single thing on your local machine, making it usable in just about any environment.

I use and like it personally, figured I'd share it, maybe someone else will find it useful too.
